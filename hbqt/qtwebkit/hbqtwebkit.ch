// enum #define QWebPage_Extension
// This enum describes the types of extensions that the page can support. Before using these extensions, you should verify that the extension is supported by calling supportsExtension().
//
#define QWebPage_ChooseMultipleFilesExtension     0    // Whether the web page supports multiple file selection. This extension is invoked when the web content requests one or more file names, for example as a result of the user clicking on a "file upload" button in a HTML form where multiple file selection is allowed.

// enum QWebPage::FindFlag
// flags QWebPage::FindFlags
// This enum describes the options available to QWebPage's findText() function. The options can be OR-ed together from the following list:
//
#define QWebPage_FindBackward                     1    // Searches backwards instead of forwards.
#define QWebPage_FindCaseSensitively              2    // By default findText() works case insensitive. Specifying this option changes the behaviour to a case sensitive find operation.
#define QWebPage_FindWrapsAroundDocument          4    // Makes findText() restart from the beginning of the document if the end was reached and the text was not found.
// The FindFlags type is a typedef for QFlags<FindFlag>. It stores an OR combination of FindFlag values.

// enum QWebPage::LinkDelegationPolicy
// This enum defines the delegation policies a webpage can have when activating links and emitting the linkClicked() signal.
//

// enum QWebPage::NavigationType
// This enum describes the types of navigation available when browsing through hyperlinked documents.
//
